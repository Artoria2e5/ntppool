<p>
    If you are distributing an appliance, operating system or other kind
    of software using the NTP Pool, you need to setup a
    "<a href="[% combust.www_url("/vendors.html") %]">vendor zone</a>".
</p>

<p>
    For internal use on systems you manage you do not need a vendor zone.
    For initial development or small-scale testing of an appliance or software,
    you don't either. However, you must setup a vendor zone before production
    deployments or distribution start.
</p>

<p>
    For open source projects this is free; for commercial products, including
    commercial open source, we ask for a nomimal annual fee (based on the number
    of clients) to support the NTP Pool Project infrastructure.
