Hello,

Your vendor DNS NTP Pool zone "[% vz.zone_name %]" has been activated.
The DNS name below will be active within the next 20 minutes.

[% IF vz.client_type == "legacy" %]
   [%- FOR i = [0..3] -%]
      [% i %].[% vz.zone_name %].[% vz.dns_root.origin %]
   [% END %]
[% ELSE %]
   [% vz.zone_name %].[% vz.dns_root.origin %]
[% END%]

For NTP clients that support the "pool" configuration, we
suggest using that.

If you have any questions, please reply to this email and we'll
help the best we can.


Kind regards,

Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen
